#### What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I'm fairly comfortable with the basic git commands, but need to explore the more advanced options available for each command, such as the various flags.


#### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

My understanding of origin in the command git push origin master turned out to be much hazier than I had thought. It turns out that "origin" is just an alias on your local machine for a particular remote repository, and it happens to be the default name. You can change the name, and would have several different alias names if you were working with multiple remote repositories at the same time.


#### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair some questions about his usage of wildcards in his terminal commands. I asked the guide about what he thought Dev Bootcamp was trying to teach us in terms of good practice for git and github.


#### What still confuses you about Git?

I'm still confused by some of the more esoteric errors that I receive, but reproducing the errors is often difficult. My Google-fu has definitely improved over the past week due to searching for answers to git questions.


#### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first experience of pairing in a GPS was good. I think we got off to a slow start in the beginning due to general inexperience with a 3-way remote coding session, but once we got rolling everything started to go more smoothly. Kit was a very helpful guide and knew the correct times to jump in when my pair Kevin and I were struggling. In the future I'm going to do more reviewing and research of the topics to be covered in the GPS so that I am better prepared for the actual session.
