# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was fine generally with the Git concepts prior the GPS session, although I still did not know lots of git command options.

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Merge conflict, fetch, merge as well as clone were clarified during the GPS.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my pair about some command lines and Git workflow as well.
I asked the guide to clarify the clone concept.

# What still confuses you about Git?
Sometimes I am still confused about the errors if I don't follow the workflow by accident.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
The first experience of pairing in GPS was good, my pair and the guide help me to clarify some concepts and I learned some new commands from them as well.
