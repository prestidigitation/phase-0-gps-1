# This is GPS 1.1

**What about GPS 1.1** 
Part of it is the test for *markdown* file. 
For example, I like fruits:
* Strawberry
* Orange
* Pear
* Watermelon

*Markdown* file also can use code section like below:

```Ruby
puts "What's your name?"
answer = gets.chomp
```
I use [google](https://www.google.com/) often when I have questions about coding.
